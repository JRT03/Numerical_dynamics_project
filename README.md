# Mars_lander_project
This repository contains some of a mars lander project completed as part of the univeristy course.

Specifically the first two assignments relating to use of euler and verlet integration techniques for two physical applications. A simple mass on a spring and then some orbital mechanics.

The later parts of the assignment were related to simulating a mars lander. The source code was supplied containing the grpahics and other fundamental parts of the simulation. The assignmenet required implementation of the numerial dynamics and a proportional control system for landing. I cannot publish my changes to the source code in order to keep the assignment useful for future generations of students. I implemented the numerical dynamics part of the system and included drag which took into account the projected area of the lander. This part of the assignment was written in C++.
